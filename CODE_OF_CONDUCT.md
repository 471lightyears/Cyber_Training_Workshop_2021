## Workshop Objectives

* Get **familiar with a variety of software** relevant to modeling excited states phenomena
* Get an overview of **theoretical background** for corresponding computational methods
* Get a **practical experience** with new tools and packages


## Schedule of the workshop

<embed src="files/Schedule.pdf" width="100%" height="500" type='application/pdf'>


## Project rules

* Consist of: a) short written report, b) presentation at the last day of workshop; c) set of input/output files deposited on the GitHub repository
* Should actively involve one of the packages discussed over the workshop period 
* Preferably not something you have an extensive experience with 
* Doesn't have to be a full-scale research project, but can be a step towards this direction
* Projects completed using local or home institution resources are eligible
* Can be an application of coding project
* The consistency in your course work during this school will contribute to your chances to win the awards
* The awards decisions will be made based on the committee evaluation
