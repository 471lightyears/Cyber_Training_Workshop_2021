### Initial README.md 

- Python folder contains the day one exercises/addition of the integrators.

- MIW folder contains the 1D implementation of the MIW forces, with example being in a harmonic oscillator.

- Parameter Fitting contains the fitting process of LJ parameters to a Cd44S44 Quantum Dot.

- NACs not yet added, but making a pull request before it is too late in the evening.

- ProjectLog contains the pdf description of all projects. This too will hopefully be updated with additional results on the NACs.
